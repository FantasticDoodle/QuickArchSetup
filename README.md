# QuickArchSetup

This repo is designed for me to be able to run various scripts and most of my settings/programs set up.

## Downloading the files remotely
on another machine (assuming this is a brand new install of arch) open this repo, click the script you want and press "raw". within bash enter a ```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xxxxxx/xxxxxxxxx``` replacing the x's with the link of the script in raw mode.
